Welcome to Courseldr

---

Courseldr is an app where university students can review courses they have completed/attended to give future students
brief but analyzed look at what is waiting for them at the chosen course. All reviews are subjective so readers can agree
or disagree with provided functionality for that and, of course, by commenting.

Besides general text description the key components that will further promote informativiness of the review are:
- star/scale evaluation of course difficulty, time consumingness and more
- courses's dependence on external sources (material)
- course's practical credit amount compared to officially declared amount in the curriculum based on time consumingness and used hours
- & more

If course review's disagreements highly outweigh agreements the review will be deleted, automatically.

Users have to be signed in order to interact with reviews or to create them. Users also have unique profiles, where user can add publicly
available information to their profile like age, university, degree title and more.
